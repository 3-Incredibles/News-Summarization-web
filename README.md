# News-Sumarization-web

Everyday news is an essential part of our lives. It gives us information on the current affairs of the entire world. Comprehending and keeping track of news can be difficult altogether due to the busy lives of people nowadays. Thus converting that audio-recorded news into summarized texts will make news reading easy and simple to understand.

We propose abstractive text summarization using Google's PEGASUS Model on audio input files and store the final summary in a text document.
